## Current Progress

We've successfully implemented:
- ✅ Dynamic graph visualization framework
- ✅ Word definition view with responsive layout
- ✅ Navigation node system with central node responsiveness
- ✅ Definition node responsiveness to other nodes' expansion states
- ✅ Preview/detail mode transitions
- ✅ Basic user authentication and profile
- ✅ Voting functionality for definitions

## Development Guidelines

When implementing features, follow these architectural principles:

1. **Single Source of Truth**
   - Store authoritative state in stores, not components
   - Ensure consistent data flow through the application
   - Use derived stores for computed values

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Layout strategies handle positioning only
   - Components handle rendering only
   - Stores handle state management only

3. **Clear Communication Patterns**
   - Events flow up from components to parents
   - Props flow down from parents to components
   - Stores provide cross-component communication

4. **Progressive Enhancement**
   - Ensure core functionality works first
   - Add animations and transitions last
   - Consider accessibility throughout development

5. **Consistent Naming**
   - Use clear prefixes for component types (Base*, Layout*, etc.)
   - Follow established patterns for method naming
   - Document any deviations from patterns

This TODO will be updated as features are completed and priorities evolve.
